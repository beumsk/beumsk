### Hi there 🥳

✨ I am a Web Lover based in Brussels and I focus myself on **Front-end Development**.

💻 I have always enjoyed building in my life: I started with **Legos**, continued with **Minecraft** and eventually got to **Web development**.

💼 Don't hesitate to **check my repos** and for a better overview of my projects, you can check out **[my Portfolio](https://remybeumier.be)** or **[my Resume](https://remybeumier.be/remy-beumier-resume.html)**.
